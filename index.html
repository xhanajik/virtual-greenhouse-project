                        ABSTRACT:
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        <b>Background:</b> It has been demonstrated that clinical decision support
systems (CDSSs), especially those used in oncology, improve patient
outcomes and lower healthcare costs. Nevertheless, despite substantial
advancements over the past few decades, CDSSs are often underutilized
in routine clinical practice. Furthermore, none of the top
commercial oncology CDSSs support active patient participation in
treatment decision-making or functional data integration despite both
being crucial in a clinical specialty that uses treatments with significant
long-term effects on patients. <br>
<b>Objective:</b> To conduct a systematic review to find existing CDSSs applicable
to precision oncology and compare their capabilities with
the system requirements and expectations set by a clinical oncologist,
such as the degree of reflecting individual patient biological profiles
and their lifestyle preferences. <br>
<b>Methods:</b> Studies describing eligible CDSS were selected via a systematic
review following established guidelines. Earlier, the CDSS
requirements were collected using a direct approach in the form of
a semi-structured interview with a practicing clinical oncologist and
reported using a requirement elicitation and reporting strategy with
suitable templates regarding the multidisciplinary nature of CDSS
development. <br>
<b>Results:</b> Altogether, the PubMed search yielded 871 articles. Their
abstracts were manually screened with 124 full-text articles assessed
for eligibility. A total of fifty papers were included in the review, and
a total of twelve CDSSs were identified. Additionally, the identified
CDSSs were summarized, and subsequently, the results from the requirement
elicitation and the review were synthesized. Seven out of
the twelve systems provide decision support for a wide range of oncological
conditions. The rest propose treatment recommendations only
for a selected type of cancer (two for breast cancer, two for prostate
cancer, and one for rectal cancer). Additionally, six information storage
requirements and four functional requirements are defined. <br>
<b>Conclusion:</b> Despite none of the CDSS fitting all the requirements
set by a domain expert, most of the identified systems incorporate a
portion of the expected functionality and seem to represent an effort
towards a true precision-medicine approach in oncology. Nevertheless,
CDSSs are continuously being developed or improved, and the
proposed requirements could illustrate a good starting point for developers.
Moreover, a participatory design method with the involvement
of real-life oncologists and other medical professionals is crucial for
creating successful, usable, and appropriate CDSSs.
