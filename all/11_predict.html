                      Predict: Breast Cancer consists of prediction models that can be used
to help make informed decisions about treatment following surgery
for early invasive breast cancer [1]. Its simple interface and usability
make it a valuable tool for patients and oncologists [2]. Based on
several patient parameters, it calculates the overall survival rates after
five, ten, and fifteen years based on the selected post-surgery treatment
plans. The treatment options included in the predictions are hormone
therapy, chemotherapy (second and third generation), trastuzumab, bisphosphonates, and combinations of the forenamed therapies [3].
The tool is available at https://breast.predict.nhs.uk.
<br> <br>
                     <div class="subheading mb-3"> Approach </div>
Data from over 5,500 breast cancer patients were used in
the development of Predict: Breast Cancer. The tool comprises two
separate prediction models for ER-positive and ER-negative breast
cancer. Both models are multivariablefractional polynomial models
derived using Cox (proportional hazards) regression, which was used
to calculate the risk-factor coefficients for breast cancer mortality and
treatment risk factors [1, 4]. The coefficients for individual risk
factors and the open-sourced implementation of the Predict models
are available at https://breast.predict.nhs.uk/legal/algorithm.
                  <br> <br>
                    <div class="subheading mb-3"> Usage </div>
                  The Predict: Breast Cancer system is web-based and very intuitive.
After selecting the right patient and tumor characteristics on the
"Predict Tool" tab on their website, the system calculates the results,
which are presented on the same page. The results can be displayed in
the formof tables, curves, charts, texts, or icons [2]. The results obtain
information about the percentage of women who survive at least the
set amount of years (5, 10, or 15) post-surgery and the additional
benefit (by how much this percentage grows) with the individual
adjuvant treatments. <br><br>
The benefit values can then be used to decide whether the additional
treatment is profitable. For example, the Cambridge Breast Unit
suggests that if the absolute 10-year survival benefit from adjuvant
chemotherapy is <3%, chemotherapy should not be recommended.
If it is 3-5%, chemotherapy should be discussed as a possible option,
and in cases where it is >5%, chemotherapy should be recommended
[3]. <br><br>
Other than the prediction tool itself, the platform includes supplementary
information such as an overview of the tool, the validation
process, an explanation of the algorithm, and others [3,4,5].
                  <br> <br>
                    <div class="subheading mb-3"> Advantages </div>
                  The tool has an updated interface created via a usercentered
design process to make it as simple as possible, with iterative
prototype testing with patients and medical professionals [2]. Predict is also available in 6 different languages. Therefore, the system caters
to a wide range of users with varying levels of computer literacy. <br><br>
One of its main benefits is that it can be used to improve the patient’s
understanding of how different adjuvant therapies can affect
survival rates and help the patient consider whether or not they will
accept additional treatments should their oncologist suggest them.
                  
<br> <br>
                    <div class="subheading mb-3"> Limitations </div>
                  The predictive models do not take into consideration the
possible side effects [5], which can significantly impact the patients’
lifestyles or the comorbidities of individual patients [2]. <br>
Moreover, while the tool effectively supports shared decision-making,
its functionality is rather limited. It provides predictions for
general adjuvant treatment methods (for example, chemotherapy or
hormone therapy), yet it does not offer any patient-tailored drug recommendations,
for example, specific chemotherapeutic agents. However,
Predict: Breast Cancer could be used to assess the overall need
for adjuvant therapies and be followed up with another system, for
instance, a CDSS that links actionable variants from sequenced tumor
samples to drugs to create a treatment plan.<br>
Nevertheless, the system is still only limited to only certain types
of breast cancer [5], as well as specific additional treatments (for
example, radiation therapy is not included) [2].
