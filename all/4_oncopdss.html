                      Oncology Pharmacotherapy Decision Support System (OncoPDSS) is
a web server that can be used by researchers and clinicians alike, as it
serves as a knowledge base on cancer precision medicine. Xu et al. [1]
aimed to not only ensure that the small amount of clinically actionable
mutations is well recorded but also that there is a decision support tool
that can aid clinicians and oncologists in keeping abreast of the rapid
advancements in clinical tumor sequencing. Specifically, the evidence-based
CDSS helps clinicians with pharmacotherapy decision-making
by using actionable alterations associated with clinical implications to
interpret sequencing results accurately at the individual level. <br><br>
To continue fulfilling their objective, they plan to continue to incorporate
more actionable evidence, drug indications, and clinical trial
information to keep the knowledge base up to date [1].
                      <br> <br>
                     <div class="subheading mb-3"> Data </div>
                  The OncoPDSS knowledgebase curates oncology pharmacotherapy
evidence consisting of alteration-drug associations (compiled
from the CIViC, CGI, OncoKB, and PubMed databases), information
about clinical-trial (from the ClinicalTrials.gov database), and FDAapproved
drug indications [37]. The evidence in the KB is arranged
into levels. To achieve this, the actionable evidence was divided into
six categories based on their initial sources: case reports, clinical trials,
approved drug labels, guidelines, inferential procedures, and preclinical
information. As of 2022, the OncoPDSS knowledge base contained
9,754 actionable evidence, 483 drug indications, 13,280 clinical trials,
2,140 ant-cancer agents, 784 cancer-related genes, 642 cancer types,
and 30,839 alterations (related to at least 29 alteration types) [1, 2].
<br> <br>
                     <div class="subheading mb-3"> Approach </div>
To interpret each piece of evidence, the CDSS assigns a
’direction’ to the pharmacotherapy according to each patient’s specific
cancer type and all detected alterations. The three types of directions
are:
                  <ul class="fa-ul mb-0">
                        <li>
                            <span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-check"></i></span>
                           Positive - evidence shows that oncologists can take the therapy
into consideration
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-check"></i></span>
                            Negative - unclear if the therapy is safe or effective
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-check"></i></span>
                            Unclassified - potentially effective therapy but not approved/accepted
by FDA or guidelines (mainly included for research purposes)
                        </li>
                    </ul> <br> <br>
                  Therapy is generally considered ’positive’ if the evidence indicates
its sensitivity and safety. On the contrary, ’negative’ therapies show
signs of resistance and high toxicity. What is more, therapy will never
be tagged as ’positive’ if there is any actionable evidence proving its
ineffectiveness [1].
                  <br> <br>
                    <div class="subheading mb-3"> Usage </div>
                  The CDSS is available on their website under the "interpret"
button on the navigation bar. Firstly, you choose the cancer types (one
or more) via a cancer tree, then the system asks for alterations in the
standard VCF file, pre-defined Excel file, text file format, or via the text
field as an input. In the query, the user can specify information about
drug indications and clinical trials so that only relevant clinical trials
are evaluated [1, 2]. In the interpretation report, the alteration-drug
association query result and the positive pharmacotherapies will be
most influential for clinicians [1].
<br> <br>
                    <div class="subheading mb-3"> Advantages </div>
                  Besides the overall usefulness of the continuously updated
webserver to practicing oncologists and cancer researchers, the
system has a couple of neat features. Not only does the CDSS find suitable
clinical trials, but it further helps the patient decide by showing
the nearest treatment centers based on the patient’s location [1]. The
CDSS is also practical in the sense that it does not merely suggest the
best therapies; it also mentions non-effective therapies with evidence
of their unsuitability [1].
                  <br> <br>
                    <div class="subheading mb-3"> Limitations </div>
                  While it is the first tool of its kind [1], OncoPDSS only
focuses solely on finding pharmacotherapy treatments from patientspecific
alterations. The system cannot be used to design a comprehensive
treatment plan containing radiotherapy or surgery. Moreover, it seems that FDA approval is required for therapies to be classified as
’positive’ [1]. It would be reasonable to include therapies approved
by other agencies, such as EMA. One of their self-reported shortcomings
is the lack of consideration of drug-drug interactions and even
food-drug interactions, yet these interactions influence drug responses
[1].
