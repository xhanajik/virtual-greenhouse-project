                     <div class="subheading mb-3"><a href="http://www.desiree-project.eu">webpage link</a></div>
                    <p>
                      The DESIREE Project, funded by The European Union, started in 2016
and was completed in July 2019. One of Desiree’s many goals was to
develop several tools focused on handling primary breast cancer. They
designed and validated a working prototype of a decision support
tool for the DESIREE platform [1]. <br>
More information about the platform, live demo availability, and
a short demo video is posted on their website: http://www.desireeproject.
eu/news/successful-completion-desiree-project.
                      <br> <br>
                     <div class="subheading mb-3"> Data </div>
                  DESIREE implements a Breast Cancer Knowledge Model
(BCKM). The BCKM leans on an Entity-Attribute-Value data model,
with the main entities being the patient, the breast side, and the lesion
[2]. This structure supports rule-based and subsumption-based reasoning
to deliver three types of recommendations: guideline-based,
case-based, and experience-based.
<br> <br>
                     <div class="subheading mb-3"> Approach </div>

                  It has been noted that conforming to clinical guidelines
gives breast cancer patients better overall survival rates and a greater
chance of recurrence-free survival [3]. DESIREE GL-DSS (Guideline-based)
represents selected clinical practice guidelines as IF-THEN
rules and yields patient-specific recommendations, mainly in the form
of procedures grouped into care plans [4]. By doing this, the DSS has
the potential to improve clinician compliance with clinical guidelines
and, therefore, continuously support physicians in choosing welldocumented
and researched treatment plans. <br><br>
On the contrary, for non-guideline-compliant decisions, DESIREE
EXP-DSS (Experience-based) takes into account previous clinical outcomes
to calculate recommendations’ confidence value (CV). New
IF-THEN rules for the knowledge base are created by combining the patient characteristics, criteria for non-compliance to guidelines taken
into consideration by the clinicians, and the final treatment that the
MTB decided upon. The CV for new rules is set to 0 and gradually
changes according to the positive or negative results. Treatment response
outcomes, adverse events, and patient-reported outcomes
(mainly in the form of questionnaires that reflect patients’ subjective
satisfaction and quality of life) are all used metrics that adjust the
CV [5]. <br><br>
                  The DESIREE CB-DSS (Case-based) depends on already solved
cases, which are stored in the patient cases database. The DSS creates
a query case and utilizes a similarity analyzer and retrieval algorithms
to obtain the most similar patient cases. These cases can then be visualized
using the rainbow box technique [4].
                  <br> <br>
                     <div class="subheading mb-3"> Usage </div>
                  The DESIREE Project publish an official demo video [6],
which demonstrated the platforms functionality well: <br> <br>
Clinicians have to manually add new patients into the system, and
the patient files can be later checked and updated. The platform also
supports adding medical image data into patient files. Other types of
data, such as treatment information, adverse events associated with
treatment, and patient-reported outcomes, are also managed in the
system. Each patient file in the system contains tabs for the patient’s
demographic data, history, first-visit information, radiodiagnosis, nuclear
medicine data, surgery data, pathology data, oncology data,
radiotherapy data, genetic data, follow-up, and patient-reported outcomes.
The system includes tools to visualize certain patient data or
statistics of treatments and outcomes. DESIREE can then produce a
summary of the patient’s current status and evolution and a timeline
of all past tests and treatments. <br><br>
The platform is also useful in the instance of a Breast Unit meeting
(essentially an MDT meeting for BC), where the system presents
relevant information, imaging data, and similar cases. The system also
implements guidelines and a conformance and evidence level, which
can be selected as the final treatment. Nevertheless, a non-guideline
form of treatment can also be entered into the system, along with the
specific criteria for non-compliance to guidelines. Among those are
also the following treatment-related patient restrictions: no surgery, no mastectomy, no endocrine therapy, no chemotherapy, monetary constraints, avoid delaying surgery, and distance constraints.
Final decisions, with all of the criteria, are later utilized to suggest
patient-specific recommendations in similar cases.                  <br> <br>
                     <div class="subheading mb-3"> Advantages </div>
                  The DESIREE platform provides a clean, unified interface
to store many kinds of patient data and provide treatment suggestions.
It also automatically adds to the patient records the final
decisions of Breast Unit meetings and implements interactive visualization
tools. The three types of recommendations offer a multitude of
treatment options. The CDSS also considers some basic patient preferences,
which gives the system a great advantage over other systems
in this study.
<br> <br>
     
                    <div class="subheading mb-3"> Limitations </div>
                  The online platform, while versatile, is not interconnected
with any EHR system, so it will take health professionals considerable
time to transfer patient data into the platform’s patient record.
