                      Roche provides multiple support tools for clinicians, all under the
common name NAVIFY. NAVIFY’s knowledge base was procured
by analyzing patient records, global medical and scientific research,
clinical trials, clinical guidelines, diagnostic testing, and input from
specialists [1]. The individual products in the NAVIFY Decision
Support portfolio are (NAVIFY Clinical Decision Support apps related
to the product are in parentheses): NAVIFY Oncology Hub, NAVIFY
Tumor Board (NAVIFY Guidelines, NAVIFY Clinical Trial Match,
NAVIFY Publication Search), NAVIFY Mutation Profiler (NAVIFY
Therapy Matcher, NAVIFY Clinical Trial Matcher), NAVIFY Mutation
Caller, NAVIFY Digital Pathology, NAVIFY Pass, NAVIFY Infection
Management (in development at the time of writing).
                      <br> <br>
                      NAVIFY Mutation Profiler (NMP), with the apps extending it, is
the most relevant product from the NAVIFY Decision Support portfolio
for this review. NMP is CE-IVD-certified software that helps interpret
clinically important, detected variants, e.g., disease-associated
variant instances, broader variant groups, variant combinations, and
variants of unknown significance, acquired by NGS testing.
                      <br> <br> 
                     <div class="subheading mb-3">Data </div>
The NMP database is curated from medical guidelines, drug
approvals, and peer-reviewed literature [2]. In 2020, the NMP variant
database contained 21,715 variants and 169,495 biomarker profiles.
<br> <br> 
                     <div class="subheading mb-3"> Approach </div>
In a 2020 comparison, Perakis et al. [3] summarized NMP’s
strategy: NMP performs a strict classification and generates a report
of somatic variants based on guidelines issued by the Association for
Molecular Pathology. It appoints the tier I (level I-A and I-B) and tier II
(only level II-C) variants as actionable and subsequently recommends
treatment based on the individual variants. Tier I (I-A, I-B) variants
are proven biomarkers with strong therapeutic or diagnostic/prognostic
significance. Tier II-C variants are variants with potential clinical
significance and serve as biomarkers with lesser evidence than the tier
I variants [4].
                  <br>
                  Perakis et al. [3] estimate that the time to generate one report (including
data upload and hands-on time) is between 30 to 45 minutes.
                  <br> <br>
                    <div class="subheading mb-3"> Usage </div>
                    As the input, NMP takes a VCF (Variant Call Format) file.
Based on the classified variant, the NAVIFY Therapy Matcher and
NAVIFY Clinical Trial Matcher apps recommend suitable therapies
or ongoing clinical trials. The NAVIFY Therapy Matcher begins its
decision-making with four fields: case ID, diagnosis, VCF file, and
assay [2]. The NAVIFY Therapy Matcher mainly suggests therapies
in concordance with guidelines. However, when a therapy is indicated
in a different geographic region, it points to potential off-label use
[2]. NMP also recommends tumor-specific combination therapies
for selected tier I variants [3]. Additionally, the final report mentions
resistance associated with alternations or mutation fusions[2]. Moreover,
the NAVIFY Clinical Trial Matcher tool offers suggestions for
clinical trials, which can be adjusted to the location. Variables that
affect clinical trial matching are the patient’s age, sex, location, tumor
type, molecular alteration, and treatment [3].<br> <br>
                  Additionally, NMP can be combined with the NAVIFY Tumor
Board tool, where the result from NMP and the patient’s clinical data
can be imported to support clinicians during MTB meetings [3].
                  <br> <br>
                    <div class="subheading mb-3"> Advantages </div>
                  Young et al. [2] reported in their study that when presenting
therapies, NMP considers the geographical region and suggests
regionally-approved treatments consistent with medical guidelines
for the location. Furthermore, they observed that the NMP database appropriately supported and included content updates for each
region. <br><br>
                  The output from NAVIFY Therapy Matcher includes which regulatory
agencies approved of the use of specific therapies. There are
multiple regulatory agencies involved, not just FDA (US Food and
Drug Administration) as in some CDSSs. The agency list includes but
may not be limited to EMA (European Medicines Agency), ESMO
(European Society for Medical Oncology), FDA, Swissmedic, HCSC
(Health Canada), NCCN (US National Comprehensive Cancer Network),
and NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence).
<br> <br>
                    <div class="subheading mb-3"> Limitations </div>
                  In cases with no targetable biomarkers, NMP does not
provide any targeted therapies [2]. In addition, NMP suggests treatments
based on individual variants as opposed to full molecular profiles.
NMP also does not take into consideration the patient’s medical
history, comorbidities, or lines of therapy [3]; however, this information
might be imported into NAVIFY Tumor Board and influence the
treatment decision. Another critical limitation for practicing clinicians
is that NMP in the US is for research use only [1].
                  <br> <br>
                    <div class="subheading mb-3"> NAVIFY Tumor Board (NTB) </div>
                  NTB is another powerful CDSS in the
portfolio. Although it does not directly provide treatment recommendations,
it can enhance decision-making by increasing efficiency, reducing
staff workload, and supporting the preparation, presentation,
and documentation of MTB meetings [5, 6]. One study reported
an average of 30% decrease in the overall preparation time of MTB
meetings after the integration period [5].
