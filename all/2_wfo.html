                     <div class="subheading mb-3"><a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson-health/solutions">webpage link</a></div>
                    <p>IBM developed this CDSS with the help of oncologists based at Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), who also curated literature
in which they evaluated their experience and knowledge. The
training of WFO lasted over four years; since then, the system gets
updated once every one to two months [1]. WFO has been in use
since 2012. Nevertheless, the IBM United States Sales Manual states
that the service was discontinued in July 2022, while in Europe, the
product has only been withdrawn from marketing [2, 3].
                     <div class="subheading mb-3"> Approach </div>
Its uniqueness compared to other CDSSs stems from the
majority of its knowledge being collected from literature, protocols,
guidelines, patient charts, and test cases and the input of experts
from the MSKCC [4, 5]. Like most CDSSs, WFO looks for traits
in patients’ EHRs, genetic information, and operability status to find
suitable treatment plans. It then uses machine learning and natural language
processing techniques to process text documents and identify
literature matching the patients’ characteristics [6].
                    <br> <br>
                    As an output, WFO produces ranked recommendations, such as
anticancer drugs, their combinations, and radiation and hormone
therapies, with the associated NCCN guidelines and other evidence
to support the recommendations [5, 6]. WFO also supplies a link to
publications concerning each treatment plan and literature from the
MSKCC database [4]. As for additional information, WFO provides
drug use instructions for each treatment plan [1], survival rate [5],
and incidence of side effects [5]. <br>
                    Each treatment recommendation is categorized into one of three
groups [1]:
                    <ul class="fa-ul mb-0">
                        <li>
                            <span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-check"></i></span>
                           green ("recommended") = recommendations with strong evidence
in their favor
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-check"></i></span>
                            yellow ("for consideration") = potentially suitable alternative
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-check"></i></span>
                            red ("not recommended") = treatment with contraindications
or lack of strong evidence
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    The use of WFO is not limited to any type of cancer, and there are
reports of its use in relation to prostate, breast, lung, gastric, thyroid,
cervical, colorectal, and other types of cancers [1, 4]. On the other
hand, WFO exclusively provides treatment options and additional
information related to them (no diagnostic or additional support).
                    <br> <br>
                    <div class="subheading mb-3"> Validation </div>
                    In 2021, Zhou Jie et al. [1] conducted a meta-analysis of
WFOin clinical application in which they compared recommendations
from WFO and a Multidisciplinary Team (MDT). By their definition,
WFO’s recommendation was concordant if the MDT’s recommended
treatment fell into the green or yellow category. They found that the
overall concordance rate was highest for breast cancer ( 90%) and lowest for gastric cancer( 58%). However, when accepting only MDT’s
recommendations consistent with the green ("recommended") category,
the overall concordance rate fell to only 29.9% for gastric cancer,
with the overall concordance of rectal cancer being the highest at
81.8%. Data also shows a statistically significant difference in consistency
for different age groups and clinical stages. Consistency for
patients >70 years of age was higher than the consistency for older
patients (P = 0.03). Likewise, the consistency of stage I - III was higher
than those of stage IV (except for lung cancer). <br> <br>
                    <div class="subheading mb-3"> Limitations </div>
                    Consistency between WFO and MDT is not satisfactory
for older patients or patients with advanced cancer [1, 5]. Furthermore,
the recommendations are limited to certain regions. Ethnic
groups differ in sensitivity and tolerance for some therapeutic drugs
or treatment methods, which WFO does not consider. Some recommended
drugs and therapies are also unavailable in specific countries
[1]. WFO does not take into account the reversibility of patients’ attributes.
WFO may exclude effective treatment plans based on abnormal
biochemical results, even if the causes behind these abnormalities
are easily treatable and resolvable in a matter of days [1]. WFO does
also not take into consideration the cost-effectiveness or insurance
coverage of its recommended treatments [1].
