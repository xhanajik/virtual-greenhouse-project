                    QIAGEN Clinical Insights is another commercial clinical decision
support tool portfolio that includes tools that translates molecular
data into therapy recommendations. <br><br>
Similar to NAVIFY, QCI Interpret One implements a tier classification;
however, it uses two types of guidelines. AMP guidelines define
which variants are actionable, and American College of Medical Genetics
and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines specify pathogenicity [1]. In
contrast to NAVIFY, QCI does not automatically prioritize alterations
or treatment recommendations but leaves this option to clinicians [1,
2]. On the other hand, QCI does include laboratory observations, the
effect on protein, predictive outcomes, somatic frequency, a thorough
explanation of the classifications, and an interactive genome browser
[1].
<br><br>
                     <div class="subheading mb-3"> Data </div>
                     Oncology practice guidelines from organizations like the American
Society of Clinical Oncology,NCCN, European Society for Medical
Oncology, Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium,
College of American Pathologists, WHO, and European LeukemiaNet
are taken into account by QCI [1]. Other considered sources and
agencies include the FDA, EMA, and Pharmaceuticals and Medical
Devices Agency drug labels. Their official website states [2] (at the
time of writing) that QCI Interpret for Oncology contains over 6.4
million variants characterized in 18,000 genes, with around 60,000
new variants added annually.
<br><br>
                     <div class="subheading mb-3"> Approach </div>
The QCI Interpret takes a VCF (Variant Call Format, a
standard file format used to express variations in gene sequences)
input file, classifies the variants using the guidelines mentioned above,
and recommends treatments based on the individual variants. At
the same time, clinicians can upload small nucleotide variations and
copy number variations or fusions for an integrative view [1, 2].
Like NAVIFY, it can recommend combination therapies for tier I variants
and includes currently enrolling relevant clinical guidelines in
its recommendations [1]. Additionally, QCI does include off-label
suggestions but only if requested. QCI also suggested therapies for
targetable aberrations, even if they were not exact matches with drugs
[1]. The final clinical report generation time is usually less than 60
minutes [1], and it contains clinically relevant variants, interpretations,
and references specified throughout the assessment [2]. Their
website [2] provides the following list of information included in
each report:

<ul class="fa-ul mb-0">

                            Therapeutic, prognostic, and diagnostic relevance
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-check"></i></span>
                            Variant interactions, such as effect of co-occurring variants on
therapies, drug resistance and sensitivities (clinical practice guideline recommendations, relevant local recruiting clinical trials, FDA-approved drug therapies, primary literature references)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="subheading mb-3"> Limitations </div>
                    Much like other alteration interpreters, it does not include
non-drug treatments.
