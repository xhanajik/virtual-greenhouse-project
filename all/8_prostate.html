                     <div class="subheading mb-3"><a href="https://scapcalculator.yuhs.ac">webpage link</a></div>
                    <p>
                      In 2019, Koo et al. [45] published an online CDSS titled "
                      Prostate
Cancer Survival Calculator According to Initial Treatment Modality" which 
employs an artificial neural network model to predict
survival outcomes according to 5 routine initial treatment modalities [1]: active surveillance, radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy with androgen deprivation therapy, radiation therapy without androgen deprivation therapy, and androgen deprivation therapy. <br>
                      The CDSS is available at https://scapcalculator.yuhs.ac.
<br> <br>
                     <div class="subheading mb-3"> Approach </div>
As already mentioned, guidelines do not present a preferable
treatment option out of the five of interest. A novel approach
executed in the form of a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) ANN
model can predict castration-resistant prostate cancer-free survival,
cancer-specific survival, and overall survival depending on the initial
treatment modality and thus recommending the best patient-specific
treatment plans [1]. <br><br>
                  Three differentANNswere trained on data retrieved from the SCaP
database. The training dataset included a total of 7,267 patient files
from the years 1988-2017. Their initial treatment selectionwas based on
surgeon discretion and patient preference [1]. Nineteen pretreatment
clinicopathological covariates (attributes) were extracted from patient
files, and the initial treatment strategies were categorized into the
five mentioned modalities. Then they observed the survival status
and the cause of death—mainly whether or not the death could be
attributed to prostate cancer, prostate cancer treatment complications,
or if progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer was
present.<br><br>
                  Out of the three developed ANN models in this study, the LSTM
ANN architecture was deemed superior. It outscored the two other
ANN models and a baseline Cox-regression model in a five-fold crossvalidation
in all survival endpoints [1].
<br> <br>
                    <div class="subheading mb-3"> Advantages </div>
                  A CDSS like this one not only serves as an accurate prediction
tool, but also promotes shared decision-making. The authors
aimed to develop an online tool that can be used to actively include
the patient in the selection of a treatment plan by providing metrics
used during patient counseling to compare optimal treatment options
at a deeper level and asses which of them sufficiently reflects the patient’s
personal preferences. For this reason, they hope that using their
easily accessible and usable free CDSS will result in more positive
patient-reported outcomes and decision satisfaction. Koo et al. [1]
also mention the usefulness of this CDSS for patients with unusual
disease features, such as avanced low-grade or localized high-grade
diseases, as their CDSS model does a better job than others at representing
patient risk.
                  <br> <br>
                    <div class="subheading mb-3"> Limitations </div>
                  All patients in the training datasetwere of Asian ethnicity.
While the estimated median cancer-specific survival is consistent with
current survival estimates, validation withworldwide population data
is needed to confirm the model’s generalizability [1]. This CDSS only
predicts outcomes for the five standard treatment options. Patient
cases in which adjuvant treatments that defied standard recommendations
were administered were excluded from the training dataset
[1]. What is more, data concerning subsequent treatments were also
not included, so the model does not offer survival predictions for
patients with multiple lines of therapy. Long-term treatment toxicity
and side effect were also out of the scope of the study; nevertheless,
these are essential factors for conforming to the patient’s treatment
preferences and expected quality of life. Lastly, treatment options and
their executions have greatly improved since 1988, so some estimated
outcomes might not reflect current expectations [1].
