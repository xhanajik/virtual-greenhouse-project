                      Developed at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, OncoKB
is a precision oncology knowledge base. It comprises biological and
clinical data regarding the genetic mutations that occur in cancer [1].
                      <br> <br>
                     <div class="subheading mb-3"> Data </div>
                  The basis for the evidence for whether or not alterations are
clinically actionable is rooted in many sources, for instance, FDA labels,
NCCN guidelines, conference proceedings, disease-focused expert
group recommendations, and medical literature [2]. Furthermore,
alterations are added if they repeatedly appear in public variant
databases. As of 2022, OncoKB contains over 5,800 alterations in 711
genes related to cancer and 123 drugs [1]. The content of OncoKB is
supervised, reviewed, and edited by a panel of oncologists and cancer
biologists [2]. Moreover, users can participate by suggesting new
clinical and research discoveries, which are then evaluated for inclusion
by the team of specialists. The new knowledge is subsequently
incorporated into the OncoKB in regular updates [2]. The data contained
in OncoKB can be found on their interactive website [1] and
is also integrated into the cBioPortal for Cancer genomics [2].
<br> <br>
                     <div class="subheading mb-3"> Approach </div>
OncoKB provides detailed, evidence-based information
about individual somatic mutations and structural alterations occurring
in patient tumors to guide the search for optimal treatment decisions. <br><br>
                  OncoKB classifies evidence, expressed as alteration and tumortype
therapeutic implications, into seven levels of evidence (OncoKB
V2), which then determine the clinical actionability of individual
alteration events [1]. Besides alterations, the tumor origin site is
a non-molecular parameter that influences the classification [2]. The
level of evidence are [1]: <br>
1 FDA-recognized biomarker associated with FDA-approved drug
response in this indication <br>
2 Standard care biomarker recommended by a guideline, associated
with an FDA-approved drug response in this indication <br>
3A Biomarker with compelling clinical evidence, associated with
drug response in this indication <br>
3B Standard care or investigational biomarker associated with an
FDA-approved or investigational drug in another indication <br>
4 Biomarker with compelling biological evidence, associated with
a drug> <br>
                  R1 Standard care biomarker associated with the resistance of an
FDA-approved drug in this indication <br>
R2 Biomarker with compelling clinical evidence associated with the
resistance to a drug
                  <br><br>
                  Based on the provided biomarkers, it reinforces the use of FDA-approved
therapies and investigational agents included in clinical trials
and prevents the off-label use of expensive drugs when evidence
points to their ineffectiveness [2]. The knowledge base is arranged
in a hierarchical order by gene, alteration, tumor type, and clinical
implication and creates a tree-like structure [2].
