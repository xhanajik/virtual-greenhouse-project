                      CorRECTreatment is an online CDS tool that serves to aid physicians
in the selection of the most appropriate treatment methods for rectal
cancer patients. Additionally, the tool can be used to predict an average overall survival time for the suggested treatment methods [1]. The
CDSS is available at https://medinfo.deu.edu.tr/dsrct/.
<br> <br>
                     <div class="subheading mb-3"> Approach </div>
Suner et al. [1] selected a combination of two approaches
to create a decision model for patient-specific treatment options, the
analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method and a decision tree model. <br><br>
The AHP method was used to mimic the natural decision-making
process of clinicians. From 388 patient data records from 1988 to 2010,
the criteria that affect decision-making, criteria levels, and priorities
were calculated via the AHP method. For instance, in the first step, the
criterion with the highest priority is "the presence of perforation", and
in the second step, "resection margin status" has the highest priority
[1]. <br><br>
Subsequently, the calculated priorities and recommended treatment
options according to the criteria levels were used to form a
decision tree. Moreover, the probabilities of recommended treatments
were assigned, and the average overall survival values of the treatments
were calculated from patient data [1].
                  <br> <br>
                    <div class="subheading mb-3"> Usage </div>
                  The CDSS works in two steps. The first step suggests treatment
methods based on eight input parameters (criteria) provided
by the user. Afterward, additional treatments to the recommended
treatment and the predicted average survival time are offered as the
output of the second step. This step uses ten criteria. In both steps, the
recommendations are sorted from the highest probable method to be
recommended to the lowest [1].
                  <br> <br>
                    <div class="subheading mb-3"> Validation </div>
                  Two general surgeons were involved in the validation of
the CDSS. The experts provided their insights on the best treatment
methods and average overall survival values for scenarios derived
from 20 cases, ten common and ten rare, from the patient dataset.
Suner et al. [1] then examined the consistency of compatibility of
expert opinions and the DSSs outputs. For the first step, the consistency
values for common and rare cases were 80% and 50%, respectively.
Likewise, in the second step, the values were 100% and 80%. This level
of consistency indicates that the model performs well [1].
<br> <br>
                    <div class="subheading mb-3"> Limitations </div>
                  The current decision tree model contains unusable branches
due to the lack of corresponding patient data; thus, some treatment
methods cannot be recommended. If there is no patient in their
database comprising 388 records that meets the selection criteria, the
CDSS will not provide any recommendations [59]. However, the structure
of the database does allow the incorporation of new cases so
that the model could use the unusable branches to recommend other
treatment options in future versions of the system [1]. <br><br>
Moreover, the patient data on which the system is based was obtained
from a single facility and is quite outdated. Current patient data
from other institutions could improve the tool by making it more general.
The system has also not been evaluated for its cost-effectiveness.
