                      This relatively new CDSS developed in the Netherlands is focused on
helping oncologists select a patient-specific treatment from two standard
therapies—radical prostatectomy (RP) and external beam radiotherapy
(EBRT)—for low- to intermediate-risk patients diagnosed
with PC. The CDSS achieves this by calculating the quality-adjusted
life years (QALYs) after 20 years and the probability percentages of
the following outcomes for RP and EBRT treatments [1]: erectile dysfunction at two years, rectal bleeding at three years, urinary incontinence at one year, and cancer free at five years. <br><br>
RP and EBRT are both common treatments with comparable survival
outcomes; however, they differ significantly in the side effects they
cause [1]. By predicting the probabilities of some of the most severe
side effects, the clinician can also consider the patient’s desires and
select the treatment accordingly. Currently, the CDSS is available at
https://ai4cancer-ai.herokuapp.com/models-browser# under
the name ProRaDS.
<br> <br>
                     <div class="subheading mb-3"> Approach </div>
For the calculation, the system uses a state-transition model
to assess the effects and costs of treatment with predictive models
(various regression models and nomograms) for tumor control and
treatment-related side effects [1].
                  <br> <br>
                    <div class="subheading mb-3"> Advantages </div>
                  ProRaDS offers a patient-specific approach to a problem
where the standard treatment plan differs from oncologist to oncologist,
not patient to patient. Van Wijk et al. [1] also conducted a
cost-effectiveness analysis and found that using ProRaDS decreases
treatment costs (with a mean decrease of 323 Euros per patient in the
Netherlands) compared to a randomized treatment allotment. Their
analysis also shows a possible slight reduction of 2% in the number of
patients with recurrence after treatment [1]. They also hypothesize
improved tumor control, reduced toxicity, and an increased number
of QALYs.
<br> <br>
                    <div class="subheading mb-3"> Limitations </div>
                  The ProRaDS tool only offers first-line treatment suggestions,
and the developer’s analyses do not take into account any
following treatments or recurrence. Furthermore, the system as it is
right now is limited to two general treatment options when in fact,
there are also others, for example, brachytherapy or active surveillance,
which is another common option for patients with prostate cancer. In
spite of this, ProRaDS only considers active forms of treatment [1]. <br><br>
                  Currently, the CDSS does not consider patient preferences, even
though PC is a prime example of howshared-decision making can positively
affect post-treatment lifestyle satisfaction. ProRaDS could use
adjustable utility values to better reflect patients’ preferences instead
of the general fixed ones received from a population [1]. Nevertheless,
the tool can still serve its purpose if the outputs are discussed at
a patient-clinician consultation and a shared decision is made. <br><br>
At the time of writing, only in silico trials took place with a synthetic
patient dataset of patients aged 75-80 [1]. Therefore, a clinical
trial would be appropriate to further validate the author’s hypotheses
and the model itself.
